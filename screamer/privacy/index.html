  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    This page is used to inform users of Screamer regarding my policies for the collection, use, and disclosure of
    Personal Information, should anyone decide to use this Service.
  </p>
  <p>To avoid ambiguity, 'Screamer' here is the Android app developed and released by Paul Guest.</p>
  <p>
    If you choose to use Screamer, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.
    The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share
    your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

  <p>
    Screamer has been designed in such a way as to operate without the collection or storage of your personal
    information. There are, however, cases where your information may be disclosed as part of the expected operation of
    the service. The service does not use information for any reason beyond those described below.
  </p>
  <h3>System Permissions</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on your particular device and operation system version, Screamer may require your permission to perform
    certain functions, which would allow access to some data that may be considered personal information.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Activity</strong></li>
    <span>
      The service can make use of your device's internal Step Counter hardware in order to improve movement detection.
      Should your device request permission to access 'Physical Activity', 'Acitivity Recognition', or some similar
      wording, it is only for the purpose of accessing the Step Counter. Step Counter events are consumed on-the-spot
      during an active service period; and are thus not stored, collected or shared.
    </span>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lockscreen Contact Information</h3>
  <p>
    Should you choose to enable the function to show your contact information on the lockscreen, you will be asked to
    supply some personal data. This
    function is disabled by default, and the choice is yours to opt in. The information that you provide to this
    function is <strong>encrypted</strong> before storage on your device, and is never accessed for any purpose other
    than:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>when you update that information on the preferences page;</li>
    <li>when the lockscreen notification appears after a siren has been sounding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Third Parties</h3>
  <p>
    Screamer uses third-party service providers that may collect information used to identify you. Links to their
    privacy policies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Google Play Services
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    In the case of an error in the app, the operating system may collect data and information (through third-party
    products) related to the error. This data may include information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address,
    device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date, and other statistics. Should
    the collected information inadvertantly contain any private data, that data will be anonymised immediately. </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to this system-collected log data, Screamer keeps an internal log of data related to a small number of
    recent 'active schedules'. These logs will never hold any personal information, and can only be shared by choosing
    to do so when contacting the developer via the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Email Contact</h2>
  <p>
    When you contact the developer from the 'contact' link within the app, you have the option to attach the internal
    logs mentioned above, and a rundown of the app's settings and allowed permissions. The attachment will include
    anonymous information about your device's manufacturer, model name and operating system version; and will not
    include any of your private information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your name and email address will not be collected or shared for any other purpose than to reply to your contact.
  </p>

  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
    <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I want to inform users that these third parties may have access to Log Data. The reason is to perform the tasks
    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other
    purpose; furthermore, efforts will be made to ensure data is anonymous before engaging any third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    I value your trust in providing your Personal Information, thus we are striving to protect that information. But
    remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and
    reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
    information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with
    personal information, I will immediately delete this. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
    child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take the necessary
    actions.
  </p>

  <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>
    I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any
    changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This policy is effective from 7th April 2023.
